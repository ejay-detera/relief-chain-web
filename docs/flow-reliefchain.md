# ReliefChain — App Flow and Feature Scope

**Project:** ReliefChain — Blockchain-Powered Disaster Relief Distribution Platform  
**Date:** 2026-09-24  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** MINDMESH  
**Status:** Active  
**Source of truth:** [`relief-chain.md`](relief-chain.md)  
**Related:** [BRD](brd-reliefchain.md) · [BPD](bpd-reliefchain.md) · [PRD](prd-reliefchain.md) · [SAD](sad-reliefchain.md) · [SDD](sdd-reliefchain.md) · [DSD](dsd-reliefchain.md) · [Build](build-reliefchain.md)

---

> **Source-of-truth rule.** [`relief-chain.md`](relief-chain.md) is the canonical foundation document. Resolve conflicts there first, then propagate. Agents and developers should read `relief-chain.md`, then the rest of `docs/`, before reading code.
>
> **Purpose of this document.** This is the honest status map: what is wired, what is gated or simulated, and what is only planned. It is the fastest answer to *"what actually works?"* — including in a judge Q&A.

**Legend**

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Built and wired end-to-end |
| 🟡 | Partial, mocked, simulated, or built-but-gated |
| ⬜ | Planned — no implementation in code |
| ❌ | Out of scope for v1 |

**Operating boundary:** Stellar **testnet** only, asset **RCPHP**, no monetary value. Mainnet raises `StellarConfigurationError` in `shared/stellar-config.ts`.

## 5. The two rails

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  INV["✅ Merchant signed invoice (InvoiceV1)"] --> GATE{"prepare-payment<br/>fundingSourceKind"}
  GATE -->|"'cash' ✅"| CASH["✅ Cash rail<br/>SAC transfer to merchant wallet"]
  GATE -->|"anything else ❌ rejected"| BLOCK["'Only cash funding source<br/>is supported in MVP.'"]
  BLOCK -.->|"unlock work"| VOUCH
  VOUCH["🟡 Voucher rail — VoucherContract.redeem"]
  VOUCH --> VCHK["✅ auth · lifecycle · expiry<br/>✅ contract/sac/network/asset binding<br/>✅ merchant + Ed25519 signature<br/>✅ per-tx · remaining · daily limit<br/>✅ one-time nonce<br/>✅ conservation invariants"]
  CASH --> REC["✅ Reconciliation + audit"]
  VCHK -.-> REC

  style VOUCH fill:#3d3520
  style VCHK fill:#3d3520
```

**Why this matters.** The programmable-voucher claim is the product's headline differentiator, and the enforcement logic genuinely exists and is unit-tested — including conservation invariants and atomic revert. It simply is not reachable from the app while the MVP gate stands. State it that way, precisely, rather than implying either more or less than is true.

**To unlock:** provision `STELLAR_CONTRACT_ADMIN_SECRET` (not created by `bootstrap-topology.mjs`), deploy a contract instance per activated voucher program, add funding-source selection in the client, then lift the gate in `supabase/functions/prepare-payment/index.ts`.

## 6. Roadmap items — no code today

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph now [Built]
    N1["✅ Online cash rail end-to-end"]
    N2["✅ Controls · audit · reconciliation"]
  end

  subgraph next [Planned]
    P1["⬜ Bluetooth offline sync — full build intended"]
    P2["⬜ SMS notify on release — partial scope"]
    P3["⬜ Donor view — partial scope"]
    P4["🟡 Voucher rail unlock"]
    P5["⬜ Analytics UI over existing projections"]
  end

  subgraph blocked [Must be decided first]
    B1["Offline authority + revocation"]
    B2["Balance reservation + double-redeem prevention"]
    B3["Merge / conflict resolution"]
    B4["SMS provider + consent"]
    B5["Donor privacy thresholds"]
  end

  now --> next
  P1 --> B1 & B2 & B3
  P2 --> B4
  P3 --> B5
```

**Bluetooth is a new architectural tier, not a screen.** It needs a transport, a trust model, offline authorization that can be revoked, reserved balances, replay protection, and deterministic conflict resolution. Until those are designed ([`relief-chain.md`](relief-chain.md) Q14–Q17), there are no acceptance criteria to build against.

## 8. Verification commands

Status claims in this document are checkable:

```powershell
npm run preflight      # toolchain readiness
npm run lint           # eslint, zero warnings tolerated
npm run type-check     # tsc --noEmit
npm run test:unit      # node --test
npm run test:property  # financial invariant property tests
npm run test:integration  # supabase test db
npm run validate       # full ladder incl. mobile export smoke
```

Setup, seeds, and demo accounts: [`build-reliefchain.md`](build-reliefchain.md).

*Update this document in the same change that alters feature status. A stale status map is worse than none, because it gets quoted under questioning.*
